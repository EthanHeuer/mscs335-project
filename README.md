# MIDI Music Generation

## Description

This is a final project for MSCS 335 - Machine Learning at UW-Stout. The goal of this project is to generate music using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model is trained on a dataset of MIDI files and generates new music in the form of a MIDI file.
